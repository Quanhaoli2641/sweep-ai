Important things to note:

* The project used to create the AI uses Maven.
* The IDE used to run and test the code was IntelliJ
* Included is a ["Minesweeper X" exe](https://github.com/Quanhaoli2641/sweep-ai/tree/master/Minesweeper_Game) file that runs the game
* You must run the "Minesweeper X" file and then run the AI via the project
* The AI takes screenshots of the running executable file.
* The AI also takes control of the mouse to play the game (Please do not move the mouse when playing the game)

**BEWARE**: The map generation of the game we have attached is REALLY bad. Expect to run the algorithms several times.

To understand the general limitations of our algorithms, we recommend you simulate the game around **50** times.
